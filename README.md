Audio connector breakout
========================

A PCB that I can plug a 3.5 mm mono audio cable into and then easily access the pins.

I mostly made this to make it easier to get a multi-meter or oscilloscope connected into the Eurorack (modular synthesizer) modules I'm building, to make testing easier.
